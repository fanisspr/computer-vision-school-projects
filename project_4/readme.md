# Project 4
This is the final project of the course. It has taken the form of a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/duth-cv-2019-2020-hw-4/overview/description), 
in which a DNN must be implemented in order to classify vehicle images belonging in 6 classes (airplane, bicycle, car, helicopter, motorcycle, school_bus).
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/duth-cv-2019-2020-hw-4/data) is split into train, validation and test.

In this project a ResNet is created from scratch, which blocks can be manually adjusted in order to be able to limit the amount of parameters of the network.
